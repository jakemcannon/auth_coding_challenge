### Install

Simply clone this repository and the only requirement is Python 3.6.



### How to use



The CLI requires a word, the one you would like to reverse, as the first parameter. 

Use <code>-r</code> flag if it is a single word and <code>-w</code> if it is a string of words.

If you would like to reverse the word(s) in a filename include <code>iÂ "FILE_NAME"</code>



**Single string mode**

```
python3 "Hello" -r
```

**String of words mode**

```
python3 "Hello world" -w
```

**Single string with input file mode**

```
python3 "Hello" -r -i "text.txt"
```

**String of words with input file mode**

```
python3 "Hello world" -r -i "test.txt"
```





### Testing

There were just two tests create in a TDD manner to test the single string reverse function and the string of words function.

Run tests in the same directory with:

```
python3 reverse_test.py
```
